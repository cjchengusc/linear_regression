# Machine Learning: Linear Regression

## Description
- Gradient descent algorithm is applied to linear regression.
- In gradient descent algorithm, parameters corresponding to each input features are simultaneously and repeatedly updated until they are convergent.
- Parameters converge when partial derivative of squared error cost function of each parameters reaches the minimum value.
- In other words, gradient descent algorithm is used to get parameters that minimize the cost function.
- Plotting *cost function - number of iterations* curve is a sufficient way to monitor functionality of gradient descent algorithm. Gradient descent algorithm works correctly when cost function decreases on every iteration. Also a reasonable learning rate in gradient descent algorithm is set based on performance of *cost function - number of iterations* curve.

## Execution
Simply run the `linear_regression.py` file using Python  
```
python linear_regression.py
```
The output will look like this
